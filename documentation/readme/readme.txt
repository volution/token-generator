Documentation

    WIP (work in progress)

Besides what is available by running z-tokens help and the examples there is no
other documentation at the moment.

That being said, just run the following and start experimenting with the
commands. (If there is need for documentation, besides the frugally -h for each
command, I have failed in one of the mandatory requirements, that of being
"simple to use".)

For how to download and install it see the dedicated section.

Get some help:

z-tokens -h
z-tokens generate -h
z-tokens patterns -h
